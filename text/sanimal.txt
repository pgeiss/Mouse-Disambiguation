A is a small rodent characteristically having a pointed snout, small rounded ears, a body-length scaly tail and a high breeding rate. The best known species is the common house (Mus musculus). It is also a popular pet. In some places, certain kinds of field mice are locally common. They are known to invade homes for food and shelter. Domestic mice sold as pets often differ substantially in size from the common house . This is attributable both to breeding and to different conditions in the wild. The most well known strain, the white lab , has more uniform traits that are appropriate to its use in research. The American white-footed (Peromyscus leucopus) and the deer (Peromyscus maniculatus), as well as other common species of -like rodents around the world, also sometimes live in houses. These, however, are in other genera. A typically controls the motion of a pointer in two dimensions in a graphical user interface. The turns movements of the hand backward and forward, left and right into equivalent electronic signals that in turn are used to move the pointer. The relative movements on the surface are applied to the position of the pointer on the screen, which signals the point where actions of the user take place, so that the hand movements are replicated by the pointer
