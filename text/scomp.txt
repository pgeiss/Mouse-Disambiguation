A computer is a pointing device (hand control) that detects two-dimensional motion relative to a surface. This motion is typically translated into the motion of a pointer on a display, which allows for fine control of a graphical user interface.
Physically, a mouse consists of an object held in one's hand, with one or more buttons. often also feature other elements, such as touch surfaces and wheels, which enable additional control and dimensional input. The trackball, a related pointing device, was invented. The trackball used four disks to pick up motion, two each for the X and Y directions. Several rollers provided mechanical support. When the ball was rolled, the pickup discs spun and contacts on their outer rim made periodic contact with wires, producing pulses of output with each movement of the ball.
